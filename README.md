# ToDo:
- Centralize Language settings so that individual chapters are also built correctly.\
- Speed up build process\
- Cover: I would check the margins and the position of the seal and logo against the CD manual again, and the extra margin (BCOR?) on the left looks strange on the screen.\
- Cover: At least in Chrome the colors of the Unilogo are displayed incorrectly, in Acrobat correctly.\
- Cover: I find it unusual that the author's name is the smallest and about in the middle of the page. Suggestion: Name further up\
- Cover: No typographic separation (other than font size) is unusual. Suggestion: "Master's Thesis" in italics, title in bold.\
- Page numbering: the first three pages are also numbered in Arabic.\
- The cover does not usually count towards the page numbering\
- The (non-existent) title page would be page i.\
- I am missing a title page or the title on p. 3\
- P. 3: Centering seems unusual to me, since nothing is centered on the cover (or anywhere else).\
- p. 3: "SuperviSor"\
- S. 3: I would prevent the breaks in the lab names.\
- Contents, etc.: Capitalization of headings should be consistent (see 2.1 vs. 2.2)\
- Symbols, etc.: The indentation of the first column compared to the table heading is "distracting".\
- Figure Index, etc.: Indentation "interferes".\
- It is at least unusual that there are no page numbers on the first pages of the chapters, although there is normal text. If text, then page number.\
- The chapter name in the header on both pages is also unusual.\
- Table 2.1: Table entries are not left-aligned only in exceptional cases.\
- P. 9: There are the wrong quotation marks.\
- The bibliography is usually placed at the end.\
- Bib.: There is one space too many in Rupitsch's book title and the capitalization is wrong.\
- Bibliography: References to books always contain publisher and place.\
- Bib.: DOI should be at the end without a period.\
- Glossary: The spaces at "e.g." are inconsistent.\
- Arabic page numbering usually continues to the end.\
- Speed up build process\
