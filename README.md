# ToDo:
- Centralize Language settings so that individual chapters are also built correctly.
- Speed up build process
- Cover: I would check the margins and the position of the seal and logo against the CD manual again, and the extra margin (BCOR?) on the left looks strange on the screen.
- Cover: At least in Chrome the colors of the Unilogo are displayed incorrectly, in Acrobat correctly.
- Cover: I find it unusual that the author's name is the smallest and about in the middle of the page. Suggestion: Name further up
- Cover: No typographic separation (other than font size) is unusual. Suggestion: "Master's Thesis" in italics, title in bold.
- Page numbering: the first three pages are also numbered in Arabic.
- The cover does not usually count towards the page numbering
- The (non-existent) title page would be page i.
- I am missing a title page or the title on p. 3
- P. 3: Centering seems unusual to me, since nothing is centered on the cover (or anywhere else).
- S. 3: I would prevent the breaks in the lab names.
- Symbols, etc.: The indentation of the first column compared to the table heading is "distracting".
- Figure Index, etc.: Indentation "interferes".
- It is at least unusual that there are no page numbers on the first pages of the chapters, although there is normal text. If text, then page number.
- The chapter name in the header on both pages is also unusual.
- Table 2.1: Table entries are not left-aligned only in exceptional cases.
- The bibliography is usually placed at the end.
- Bibliography: References to books always contain publisher and place.
- Bib.: DOI should be at the end without a period.
- Glossary: The spaces at "e.g." are inconsistent.
- Arabic page numbering usually continues to the end.
